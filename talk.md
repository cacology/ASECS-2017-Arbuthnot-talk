It's a pleasure to present on such a varied panel and I'm incredibly
delighted for the chance to have your feedback.  This talk represents
some, very little bit, of the content of my dissertation
but--largely--an experiment in a way of talking about reading matter
in the early part of the eighteenth-century.  I'm going to try to tell
you a three-century old joke based on mathematics: let's have at it.

It's a commonplace that the supposed 'age of reason' might be better
characterized as an aspiration, rather than an accomplishment.
Bonamy Dobrée, rightly, calls the period roughly beginning with the
Glorious Revolution and ending in the 1740s with the rise of the
middle class, an "age of attempted clarity."^[@dobree59:Enl18c, p. 16]
This clarity finds its way into poetry, a faltering of drama, and by
the mid-century--moral and devotional poetry.  We know that everyone
was reading Locke because everyone *talks* about reading Locke, but
along with his empirical project, I think there were other important
sources of reading material influencing how writing, literary and
otherwise, came to be done and read.

Indeed, I think the epoch itself worried about visualizing and
representing its own data in terms of tables, engravings, charts,
apparatuses, and especially language.  Numbers, after all, means
numbers as well as measure.

As a part of this, I'm trying to understand how one might read the
longest-running natural philosophy journal, *The Philosophical
Transactions*.  Begun in 1665, it published with some breaks, the
undertakings of the curious for Britain and the world to see.
Too often seen primarily as a precursor of the heroic accomplishments
of science under William Whewell and the present day, I think there is
value in returning to the old texts not as benighted attempts to find
modern science, but examples of thinkers deploying Augustinian prose
and language that draw on an international tradition of "classic
prose" discussed by Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner. If we want to
understand how the clarity of Blaise Pascal ends up in the mouth of
Thomas Jefferson, we need to trace the journal that introduced this
mode of writing and thinking to an English audience.

## Collation slide

In the process of working towards a descriptive bibliography of the
*Philosophical Transactions*, I'm proceeding systematically through
roughly a century of issues, which has yielded a number of interesting
articles.  Here is the collation from volume twenty-seven, number
three-hundred twenty-eight, for the end of 1710.  It's useful to note
here that the journal has taken a break from it's usual half-sheet
beginning and ending, where a shorter article is tacked onto the back
of the table of contents to fill out the issue.  Here pi-one verso
begins the real star of this issue "An Anatomical Description of the
Heart of Land Tortoises from America. By Mr. Paul Bussiere" which also
gets double-star treatment by getting an engraving.

Typically, the second article of the number is the longer one and
I think they're breaking the pattern because this issue for October,
November, and December 1710 came out around April 1711: four
months late.  After the star article, these numbers often turn to
a little bit of math or data and this one doesn't disappoint.

## Article slide
We get "An Argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant
Regularity observ'd in the Births of both Sexes. By Dr. John
Arbuthnott."  A careful viewer, or perhaps one with better eyesight
than me, will note that we have "Arbuthnott' with two 't's here, which
is not the spelling he favored in print but the one he favored in
manuscript.  We know that William Burnet, son of Gilbert Burnet, read
the paper at the Royal Society meeting on April 19,
1711.^[@shoesmith87:controversy, p.134] This was something of
a formality, as nothing could be published in the journal without
first being read at the Society.  Arbuthnot's response to Justice
Chamberlayne from 30 April 1711, thanking him for his comments,
suggests that even if Arbuthnot was in attendance at the meeting, his
paper's exposure to an audience was in the
journal. ^[@arbuthnot06:corr, p. 140--141] It's possible that he was
at the meeting, had someone else read the paper, and the unedited
manuscript was handed off to the printer, but I think it far more
likely that he sent his manuscript to be read without attending.

Not attending and having something read in was fairly common.
Arbuthnot's only other article in the *Transactions* was included in
just such a way: Edward Berkeley sent him observations on Mount
Vesuvius and told him "I doubt there is nothing in this worth shewing
the Society: as to that, you will use your discretion"
^[@arbuthnot06:corr, p.233; PT 30 pp. 708]

So, we have an article that is in a sort-of second place, read by the
author's assignee, talking about human reproduction and proving the
existence of God.  Let me walk you through the argument.

## Math slides

He argued...

Half the terms had more M than F, well, nearly, so half is a good
estimate, certainly for large n.

## Data slides

So he actually has data for 82 years.  For each of which there are
more male than female births.  He calculates the probability that this
happens as one over two raised to the power of eighty two.  That is, 1
over nearly 484 sextillion, a very small number.  He writes: "But if
A wager with B, not only that the Number of Males shall exceed that of
Females, every Year, but that this Excess shall happen in a constant
Proportion, and the Difference lye within fix'd limits; and this not
only for 82 Years, but for Ages of Ages, and not only at London, but
all over the World; ... then A's Chance will be near an infinitely
small Quantity."  Thus, "it is Art, not Chance, that governs."

Arbuthnot continues, "From hence it follows, that Polygamy is contrary
to the Law of Nature and Justice, and to the Propagation of Human
Race; for where Males and Females are in equal number, if one Man
takes Twenty Wives, Nineteen Men must live in Celibacy, which is
repugnant to the Design of Nature; nor is it probably that Twenty
Women will be so well impregnated by one Man as by Twenty."  Thus,
it's near impossible to have more male births, men die easily,
polygamy is bad, God exists, QED.

The problem is that the math is wrong.  It assumes that there is
a 50/50 chance of producing a male child, not an unreasonable
assumption, but this particular table demonstrates it to be false.
But, maybe Arbuthnot didn't notice.  Well, this data matches the data
produced by John Graunt in 1662.  The great fire of 1666 had destroyed
all the bills of mortality for the years before 1658; the only known
check on this table is John Bell's *London's Remembrancer* (1665)
which matches this and Graunts except for 1641 and 1642 which both
Arbuthnot and Graunt swapped.^[@beattie35:arbuthnot, p. 341]
Arbuthnot, thus, most likely used Graunt's tables, but along with his
tables Graunt notices the difference in birth rates between women and
men, estimating around 7/13, 14/27, or 16/31; in all cases slightly
more than half, not 50/50.^[@graunt62:natural, pp. 48--49, 64] But, perhaps he
just missed it when he copied the data.

Yet, in his *Essay on the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning*
Arbuthnot notes that he learned probability from the first treatise on
the topic by Hugenius.^[@arbuthnot01:essay, p. 33] Hugenius includes
the possibility of an unfair die in the same treatise, which would
suggest that Arbuthnot was not reading closely.  Arbuthnot's *Essay*
also mentions the "encrease and the decrease of the people" as an
appropriate topic for a gentleman to consider when learning
mathematics.^[@arbuthnot01:essay, p. 55] Since he imagines a fair die
in birth rates, perhaps he's left this as a puzzle for the gentlemen
of the Royal Society?

It's generally agreed that Arbuthnot, in-fact, translated Hugenius
into English with his *Of The Laws of Chance or a Method of the
Calculation of the Hazards of Game* which puts it more explicitly in
the preface: "if a Woman is with Child, but it shall be a Boy; and if
you would know the just odds, you must consider the Proportion in the
Bills that the Males bear to the Females."^[@arbuthnot92:lawsChance,
A9^v^] The preface furthermore suggests that the calculations might be
improved with "the Series's and Logarithms"^[@arbuthnot92:lawsChance,
A11^r^] which he does in the article.  If you believe--as the
consensus seems to since the late 19th-century--that he indeed
translated and wrote the preface to *Of The Laws of Chance* then his
paper in the *Transactions* seems stranger and stranger.  Why would he
ignore a fact he knew?  Perhaps to leave the way open for
someone else?

Well, there were a series of responses and recalculations.

## Estimates Arbuthnot

William Burnet apparently also sent Arbuthnot's paper to Dutch
mathematician Willem 'sGravesande (Ssssafga-sunda) who thought that
the argument wasn't strong enough.  Arbuthnot had merely considered
the probability that there would be *more* males each year, not the
likelihood that there would be more males born within a certain range.
Restricting the possible outcomes further to more males born within
the observed range and using the same binomial expansion we've already
seen, but for all eleven-thousand births, he found the likelihood that
the particular range of male births to be 0.2917

## Estimates 'sGravesande

So, the likelihood of observing that pattern of male births was even
less likely.  We go from 26 zeros to 45.  Much smaller.  The math
itself is very interesting, and those curious should look at Eddie
Shoesmith's paper in *Historia Mathematica*.

The problem here is still that the likelihood of a male birth is
considered 50/50, which from the observed data we know it's not.
Sometime in 1712 Niklaus Bernoulli, of the prominent family of
mathematicians, came to know of Arbuthnot's work while he was visiting
England.  'sGravesande (Ssssafga-sunda) broached the subject and
Bernoulli took it up with other members of the Royal Society.
Disagreeing with the results, Bernoulli points out what Arbuthnot
seems to have known all along, that the likelihood of male births was
not 50/50, but higher.  He takes the likelihood of a particular birth
as 18/35, which is close to what Graunt gives.  Again, after some
clever mathematics that further develop what comes to be called
binomial distributions, he comes up with a high likelihood that he
publishes in 1713.

## All estimates

In particular, he estimates that the likelihood of male births being
no more than 163 people different than the average over those years as
0.978, but observing that for 11 years out of the 82, the number fell
outside that limit, he calculated that the probability of "falling
outside the prescribed limits no more than 10 times in a run of 82
years" as 0.9999.  So, it turns out, divine providence is merely one
of the absolutely most likely outcomes given the greater frequency of
male births.

This puts Arbuthnot's paper in a strange position.  He never published
a follow-up and the only correspondence that has surfaced is his
response to Justice Chamberlayne about the problem where he suggests
not the hand of God, but "physical Causes of the production of the
different sexes.  The Most probable is that they exists [originally in
Semine Masculo]."^[@arbuthnot06:corr, p. 140--141] 

I think there's a clue in the opening phrase of Arbuthnot's paper:
"Among innumerable Footsteps of Divine Providence to be found in the
Works of Nature."  The late Robert Boyle had endowed "an Annual Salary
for some Divine or Preaching Minister, ... to preach eight sermons in
the year for proving the Christian Religion against notorious
infidels"^[@bentley92:folly A2^r^] Boyle wanted to demonstrate the
connection between natural philosophy and proper religion.
Richard Bentley gave the first eight sermons over the year 1692, which
focused on what we would now call intelligent design, where he talks
about seeing "visible footsteps" or "divine footsteps."  This word
"footsteps" comes to be associated with traces of divine: a peculiar
topic for the *Transactions*.  I can find no other paper arguing
directly for the existence of God, just using God as a sort of topos
for appreciating nature or beauty.  (though, there's a lot to read, so
I'd welcome any listeners who know of one)

More to the point of this panel, Arbuthnot is using representations of
data to argue for the existence of a deity.  Since the math turns out
to be flawed in ways that he most likely knew, we have to wonder what
he might have been doing.  I think of the *Dunciad*, which he
contributed to:

## Dunciad

[read] the *Dunciad in Four Books* glosses this as "the strange
Conclusions some Mathematicians have deduced from their principles"
and "the action of men who look about with full assurance of seeing
what does not exist, such as those who expect to find *Space* a real
being."^[@pope09:dunciad4, p. 277] Arbuthnot was the most informed of
the Scriblerians regarding mathematics, so the knowledge for the
satire of the over-reach of mathematics seems most likely to have come
from him.  The objects ridiculed here are mathematicians who ignore
the physical realities of the world in favor of metaphysical-like
musings on abstract possibilities.  Somewhat like a proof of God that
ignores a portion of the data in favor of its own conclusion.

Even the *Memoirs of Scriblerus*--yet more closely associated with
Arbuthnot's writing--play on the same image of mathematics as engaged
in political arithmetic with Scriblerus's publication

## Scribelerius

[read] Which links data collection to over-reaching calculations about
a city.^[@aitken92:life, p. 357] Scriblerus, having been brought-up as
Blaise Pascal--instructed in mathematics from an early age--produces
execrable scholarship later on.  The object of the satire here would
seem to fall fairly closely to what Arbuthnot himself was doing.  Yet,
his satire works in subtle ways.  In analyzing Arbuthnot's *The Art of
Political Lying* Conal Condren observes that it's not quite so simple
as taking the *Art* as a Tory tract, pointing out the inconsistencies
of Whiggish thought.  It "draws on and ironically generalizes from the
way in which mutual accusations about lying, cheating, and
misinformation played their part in maintaining, or even creating
group identity.  It was almost a presupposition of debate that
opposing parties were always dishonest, dishonesty helped explain why
they existed.  Most generally characterized, Arbuthnot's satire
exposed this common belief by pretending to take it with deadly
literalness."^[@condren97:satire, p. 17] That is, Arbuthnot's *Art*
takes the technique of manipulating truth and lays it on all of
humanity, not a certain crowd, by following the same sort of approach
used by Pascal in his *Provincial Letters*, a sort of earnest
explanation to someone who may not understand the subtlety of the
sorts of political arguments going on.

## Article again

As I see it, there are two possibilities then for Arbuthnot's error in
his article and the strange topic.  First, that in his enthusiasm to
encourage the gentlemen of the Royal Society to learn mathematics and
the doctrine of series in particular, he overlooked the obvious flaw
in his study, which he should have been well aware.  In this case,
while the strategy itself is not satirical, he selected birth rates
and divinity as appealing topics *because* of their significance.
Later thinking about the over-reach of data into overly-significant
topics makes this a somewhat funny self-satire in retrospect;
Arbuthnot derides the very approach he sees as critical for convincing
people, which is totally in keeping with his understanding of
political lying.  It's possible that his "overlooking" was also
knowing--maybe he knew that the data didn't support the claim he
wanted to make, but meant to give an interesting example to encourage
further research.  In this case, we have a sort of boosterism of
mathematics at the expense of reality for purposes of education--a
political lie.

Second, the possibility is that he *meant* the article to be an
elaborate straight-faced joke about the limitations of mathematics.
Before we decide this is implausible as being too obscure, remember that
Samuel Johnson noted that Arbuthnot's *Memoirs* didn't succeed because
the philosophy was too obscure to be of broad interest.
Arbuthnot's response to Justice Chamberlayne, that he should think of
semen, not look to God, suggests that he intended the error to be
uncovered and noticed.  Since he does no further work in this area, it
seems suspicious that he was playing some sort of joke on the idea of
how eagerly people like Richard Bentley were world-building under the
guise of linking theology to natural philosophy.

Then again, these two options aren't really that different.  I think
plenty of people have noted that the news these days matches the jokes
a bit too closely to be comfortable.  Sometimes a text doesn't have to
be intended to be satire to satirize, even before we declared
irony dead.
