It's a pleasure to present on such a varied panel and I'm particularly
eager for your feedback.  This talk represents some, very little bit,
of the content of my dissertation but--largely--an experiment in a way
of talking about reading matter in the early part of the
eighteenth century.  I'm going to try to tell you a three-century old
joke based on mathematics: let's have at it.

It's a commonplace that the supposed 'age of reason' might be better
characterized as an aspiration, rather than an accomplishment.
Bonamy Dobrée, rightly, calls the period beginning roughly with the
Glorious Revolution and ending in the 1740s with the rise of the
middle class, an "age of attempted clarity."^[@dobree59:Enl18c, p. 16]
This clarity finds its way into poetry, a faltering of drama, and by
the mid-century--novels.  We know that everyone was appreciating the
clarity of Locke because everyone *talks* about reading Locke, but
along with his empirical project, I think there were other important
sources of reading material influencing how writing, literary and
otherwise, came to be done and read.

Indeed, I think many writers of the epoch worried about clearly
visualizing and representing data in terms of tables, engravings,
charts, apparatuses, and especially language.  Numbers, after all,
means numbers as well as measure.

As a part of this, I'm trying to understand how one might read the
longest-running natural philosophy journal, *The Philosophical
Transactions*.  Begun in 1665, it published with some breaks, the
undertakings of the curious for Britain and the world to see.
Too often seen primarily as a precursor to the heroic accomplishments
of science under William Whewell and the present day, I think there is
value in returning to the old texts not as benighted attempts to
achieve modern science, but examples of thinkers deploying Augustinian
prose and language that draw on an international tradition of "classic
prose" discussed by Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner. If we want to
understand how the clarity of Blaise Pascal ends up in the mouth of
Thomas Jefferson, we need to trace the journal that introduced this
mode of writing and thinking to an English audience.

## Collation slide

In the process of working towards a descriptive bibliography of the
*Philosophical Transactions*, I'm proceeding systematically through
roughly a century of issues, which has yielded a number of interesting
articles.  Here is the collation from volume twenty-seven, number
three-hundred twenty-eight, for the end of 1710.  It's useful to note
here that the journal has taken a break from it's usual half-sheet
beginning and ending, where a shorter article is tacked onto the back
of the table of contents to fill out the issue.  Here pi-one verso
begins the real star of this issue "An Anatomical Description of the
Heart of Land Tortoises from America. By Mr. Paul Bussiere" which also
gets double-star treatment by getting an engraving.

Typically, the second article of the number is the longer one and
I think they're breaking the pattern because this issue for October,
November, and December 1710 came out around April 1711: four
months late.  After the star article, these numbers often turn to
a little bit of math or data and this one doesn't disappoint.

## Article slide
We get "An Argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant
Regularity observ'd in the Births of both Sexes. By Dr. John
Arbuthnott."  A careful viewer, or perhaps one with better eyesight
than me, will note that we have "Arbuthnott' with two 't's here, which
is not the spelling he favored in print but the one he favored in
manuscript.  We know that William Burnet, son of Gilbert Burnet, read
the paper at the Royal Society meeting on April 19,
1711.^[@shoesmith87:controversy, p.134] This was something of
a formality, as nothing could be published in the journal without
first being read at the Society.^[Arbuthnot's response to Justice
Chamberlayne from 30 April 1711, thanking him for his comments,
suggests that even if Arbuthnot was in attendance at the meeting, his
paper's exposure to an audience was in the journal.[@arbuthnot06:corr,
p. 140--141]] It's possible that Arbuthnot was at the meeting, had
someone else read the paper, and the unedited manuscript was handed
off to the printer, but I think it far more likely that he sent his
manuscript to be read without attending.

Not attending and having something read in was fairly common.
Arbuthnot's only other article in the *Transactions* was included in
just such a way: Edward Berkeley sent him observations by letter on
Mount Vesuvius and told him "I doubt there is nothing in this worth
shewing the Society: as to that, you will use your discretion"
^[@arbuthnot06:corr, p.233; PT 30 pp. 708]

So, we have an article that is in a sort-of second place, read by the
author's assignee, talking about human reproduction and proving the
existence of God.  Let me walk you through the argument.

## M+F

He represents one birth as being either male or female by addition.
M plus F is two terms, one M, one F, so the probability of either M or
F is one out of two.

## (M+F)^2^

This can be extended to two births, both either M or F, but multiplied
together.  If you remember foil, from algebra, you'll see the
expansion here is M squared, 2 MF, F squared.  This makes sense
because there is only one way to get two Ms, male birth followed by
male birth; there's only one way to get two Fs, female followed by
female; and, there's two ways to get MF: a male birth followed by
a female birth, or a female birth followed by a male one.

## (M+F)^n^

Now, Arbuthnot extends this to an arbitrary large number, n, say the
number of births in a year.  He spends a great deal of time explaining
how the binomial expansion works, but basically, we have--still--only
one way to get all male or all female. But n ways to get one male
among all other female births--any one birth can deviate.
It's a straightforward matter to see that the coefficients of each of
the terms are mirrored across the middle and he spends some time
explaining how to calculate this.

Thus--and this is the critical bit--in the left half of the formula,
Ms dominate; there are more Ms than Fs for half the possibilities. So,
half the terms had more M than F, well, nearly, so half is a good
estimate, certainly for large n.

## Data slides

So he actually has data for 82 years.  For each of which there are
more male than female births.  He calculates the probability that this
happens as one over two raised to the power of eighty two.  That is, 1
over nearly 484 sextillion, a very small number representing something
very unlikely.  He writes: "But if A wager with B, not only that the
Number of Males shall exceed that of Females, every Year, but that
this Excess shall happen in a constant Proportion, and the Difference
lye within fix'd limits; and this not only for 82 Years, but for Ages
of Ages, and not only at London, but all over the World; ... then A's
Chance will be near an infinitely small Quantity."  Thus, "it is Art,
not Chance, that governs."

Arbuthnot continues, "From hence it follows, that Polygamy is contrary
**to the Law** of Nature and Justice, and to the Propagation of Human
Race; for where Males and Females are in equal number, if one Man
takes Twenty Wives, Nineteen Men must live in Celibacy, which is
repugnant to the Design of Nature; nor is it probably that Twenty
Women will be so well impregnated by one Man as by Twenty."  Thus,
it's near impossible to have more male births, men die easily,
polygamy is bad, God exists, QED.

The problem is that the math is wrong.  It assumes that there is
a 50/50 chance of producing a male child, not an unreasonable
assumption, but this particular table demonstrates it to be false.
But, maybe Arbuthnot didn't notice.  Well, this data matches the data
produced by John Graunt in 1662; they both swapped 1641 and 42 and the
only other data available didn't. ^[The great
fire of 1666 had destroyed all the bills of mortality for the years
before 1658; the only known check on this table is John Bell's
*London's Remembrancer* (1665) which matches this and Graunts except
for 1641 and 1642 which both Arbuthnot and Graunt
swapped.^[@beattie35:arbuthnot, p. 341]] Arbuthnot, thus, most likely
used Graunt's tables, but along with his tables Graunt notices the
difference in birth rates between women and men, estimating slightly
more than half would be born male, not 50/50.^[@graunt62:natural,
pp. 48--49, 64] But, perhaps Arbuthnot just missed it when he copied
the data.

Arbuthnot's *Essay on the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning* also
mentions the "encrease and the decrease of the people" as an
appropriate topic for a gentleman to consider when learning
mathematics and suggests that Arbuthnot knew of the possibility of an
unfair die.^[@arbuthnot01:essay, p. 55] Since he imagines a fair die
in birth rates, perhaps he's left this as a puzzle for the gentlemen
of the Royal Society?^[In his *Essay on the Usefulness of
Mathematical Learning* Arbuthnot notes that he learned probability
from the first treatise on the topic by Hugenius.^[@arbuthnot01:essay,
p. 33] Hugenius includes the possibility of an unfair die in the same
treatise, which would suggest that Arbuthnot was not reading closely.
]

It's generally agreed that Arbuthnot translated Hugenius into English
with his *Of The Laws of Chance or a Method of the Calculation of the
Hazards of Game* which puts it more explicitly in the preface: "if
a Woman is with Child, but it shall be a Boy; and if you would know
the just odds, you must consider the Proportion in the Bills that the
Males bear to the Females."^[@arbuthnot92:lawsChance, A9^v^] The
preface furthermore suggests that the calculations might be improved
with "the Series's and Logarithms"^[@arbuthnot92:lawsChance, A11^r^]
which he does in the article.  If you believe--as the consensus seems
to since the late 19th-century--that he indeed translated and wrote
the preface to *Of The Laws of Chance* then his paper in the
*Transactions* seems stranger and stranger.  Why would he ignore
a fact he knew?  Perhaps to leave the way open for someone else?

Well, there were a series of responses and recalculations.

## Estimates Arbuthnot

William Burnet apparently also sent Arbuthnot's paper to Dutch
mathematician Willem 'sGravesande (Ssssafga-sunda) who thought that
the argument wasn't strong enough.  Arbuthnot had merely considered
the probability that there would be *more* males each year, not the
likelihood that there would be more males born within a certain range.
Restricting the possible outcomes further to more males born within
the observed range and using the same binomial expansion we've already
seen, he found a different probability.

## Estimates 'sGravesande

So, the likelihood of observing that pattern of male births was even
less likely.  We go from 26 zeros to 45.  Much smaller.  The math
itself is very interesting, and those curious should look at Eddie
Shoesmith's paper in *Historia Mathematica*.

The problem here is still that the likelihood of a male birth is
considered 50/50, which from the observed data we know it's not.
Sometime in 1712 Niklaus Bernoulli, of the prominent family of
mathematicians, came to know of Arbuthnot's work while he was visiting
England.  'sGravesande (Ssssafga-sunda) broached the subject and
Bernoulli took it up with other members of the Royal Society.
Disagreeing with the results, Bernoulli points out what Arbuthnot
seems to have known all along, that the likelihood of male births was
not 50/50, but higher.  He takes the likelihood of a particular birth
as 18/35, which is close to what Graunt gives.  Again, after some
clever mathematics that further develop what comes to be called
binomial distributions, he comes up with a high likelihood that he
publishes in 1713.

## All estimates

He calculates the probability of achieving the average number of
surplus male births within a small range and, furthermore, the
probability that the birth rate might deviate the few times it
did.^[In particular, he estimates that the likelihood of male births
being no more than 163 people different than the average over those
years as 0.978, but observing that for 11 years out of the 82, the
number fell outside that limit, he calculated that the probability of
"falling outside the prescribed limits no more than 10 times in a run
of 82 years" as 0.9999.]  So, it turns out, divine providence is
merely one of the absolutely most likely outcomes given the greater
frequency of male births.

This puts Arbuthnot's paper in a strange position.  He never published
a follow-up and the only correspondence that has surfaced is his
response to Justice Chamberlayne about the problem where he suggests
not the hand of God, but "physical Causes of the production of the
different sexes.  The Most probable is that they exists [originally in
Semine Masculo]."^[@arbuthnot06:corr, p. 140--141] 

I think there's a clue, though, in the opening phrase of Arbuthnot's
paper: "Among innumerable Footsteps of Divine Providence to be found
in the Works of Nature."  The late Robert Boyle had endowed "an Annual
Salary for some Divine or Preaching Minister, ... to preach eight
sermons in the year for proving the Christian Religion against
notorious infidels"^[@bentley92:folly A2^r^], connecting natural
philosophy with proper religion.  Richard Bentley gave the first eight
sermons over the year 1692, which focused on what we would now call
intelligent design, where he talks about seeing "visible footsteps" or
"divine footsteps."  And, this word "footsteps" comes to be associated
with traces of divine: a peculiar topic for the *Transactions*.  I can
find no other paper arguing directly for the existence of God, just
using God as a sort of topos for appreciating nature or beauty.
(though, there's a lot to read, so I'd welcome any listeners who know
of one)

More to the point of this panel, Arbuthnot is using representations of
data to argue for the existence of a deity.  Since the math turns out
to be flawed in ways that he most likely knew, we have to wonder what
he might have been doing.  I think of the *Dunciad*, which he
contributed to:

## Dunciad

[No read] the *Dunciad in Four Books* glosses this passage with
Mathesis as "the strange Conclusions some Mathematicians have deduced
from their principles" and "the action of men who look about with full
assurance of seeing what does not exist, such as those who expect to
find *Space* a real being."^[@pope09:dunciad4, p. 277] Arbuthnot was
the most informed of the Scriblerians regarding mathematics, so the
knowledge for this satire of the over-reach of mathematics seems most
likely to have come from him.  The objects ridiculed here are
mathematicians who ignore physical reality in favor of
metaphysical-like musings on abstract possibilities.  Somewhat like
a proof of God that ignores a portion of the data in favor of its
own conclusion.

The *Memoirs of Scriblerus*--yet more closely associated with
Arbuthnot's writing--play on the same image of mathematics as engaged
in political arithmetic with one of Scriblerus's publications

## Scribelerius

[read] This fictional title links data collection to over-reaching
calculations about a city.^[@aitken92:life, p. 357] Scriblerus, having
been brought-up as Blaise Pascal--instructed in mathematics from an
early age--produces execrable scholarship later on.  The object of the
satire here would seem to fall fairly closely to what Arbuthnot
himself was doing.  Yet, his satire works in subtle ways.
Analyzing Arbuthnot's *The Art of Political Lying* Conal Condren
observes that it's not a party tract; it's not a Tory accusation of
bad Whiggish thought, but accuses everyone of manipulating truth to
their own ends.  He says "Arbuthnot's satire exposed ... [the] common
belief [that lying, cheating, and misinformation played their part in
creating group identity] by pretending to take it with deadly
literalness."^[@condren97:satire, p. 17] Following Pascal in his
*Provincial Letters*, Arbuthnot seems present an earnest explanation
to someone who may not understand the subtlety of the sorts of
political arguments going on. ^[In analyzing Arbuthnot's *The Art of
Political Lying* Conal Condren observes that it's not quite so simple
as taking the *Art* as a Tory tract, that points out inconsistencies
in Whiggish thought.  But, that it "draws on and ironically
generalizes from the way in which mutual accusations about lying,
cheating, and misinformation played their part in maintaining, or even
creating group identity.  It was almost a presupposition of debate
that opposing parties were always dishonest, dishonesty helped explain
why they existed.  Most generally characterized, Arbuthnot's satire
exposed this common belief by pretending to take it with deadly
literalness."^[@condren97:satire, p. 17] That is, Arbuthnot's *Art*
takes the technique of manipulating truth and lays it on all of
humanity, not a certain crowd, by following the same sort of approach
used by Pascal in his *Provincial Letters*, a sort of earnest
explanation to someone who may not understand the subtlety of the
sorts of political arguments going on.]

## Article again

As I see it, there are two possibilities then for Arbuthnot's error in
his article and the strange topic.  First, that in his enthusiasm to
encourage the gentlemen of the Royal Society to take-up mathematics
and the doctrine of series in particular, he overlooked the obvious
flaw in his study, which he should have been well aware.  In this
case, while the strategy itself is not satirical, he selected birth
rates and divinity as appealing topics *because* of their
significance.  Later thinking about the over-reach of data into
overly-significant topics makes this a somewhat funny self-satire in
retrospect; Arbuthnot derides the very approach he sees as critical
for convincing people, which is totally in keeping with his
understanding of political lying.  It's also possible that his
"overlooking" was knowing--maybe he knew that the data didn't support
the claim he wanted to make, but meant to give an interesting example
to encourage further research.  In this case, we have a sort of
boosterism of mathematics at the expense of reality for purposes of
education--another political lie.

Second, perhaps he *meant* the article to be an elaborate
straight-faced joke about the limitations of mathematics.  Before we
decide this is implausible as being too obscure, remember that Samuel
Johnson noted that Arbuthnot's *Memoirs* didn't succeed because the
philosophy was too obscure to be of broad interest.
Arbuthnot's response to Justice Chamberlayne, that he should think of
semen, not look to God, suggests that he intended the error to be
uncovered and noticed.  Since he does no further work in this area, it
seems possible that he was playing some sort of joke on the idea of
how eagerly people like Richard Bentley were world-building under the
guise of linking theology to natural philosophy.

Then again, these two options aren't really that different.  I think
plenty of people have noted that the news these days matches the jokes
a bit too closely to be comfortable.  Sometimes a text doesn't have to
be intended to be satire to satirize, even before we declared
irony dead.
